      <p>I am Miguel Rodr√≠guez</p>
      <p>
        I am a software engineer passionate about distributed systems and JVM
        languages. I find myself comfortable in both small multidisciplinary
        teams and also in big specialized ones. As I evolve during my career, I
        developed a good understanding of clean code and design patterns, and I
        love to discuss with my colleagues their vision about these hot topics.
